Weini did an amazing job creating a whimsical and lively frog character for this game. The frog character is super cute and full of personality (She told me that her spiritual animal is frog). The opening scene was very unique, when you trigger it, the frog’s mouth suddenly grows huge and swallows the whole screen. It’s funny, unexpected, and instantly pulls you into the game. I also really like how the flies keep flashing different colors in the gameplay. It makes the scene feel lively, and at the same time, it adds a fun challenge because it’s harder to spot them when they’re constantly changing.

Ben’s game really impressed me because it feels very complete and surprisingly complex. The frogs and the background both look polished and visually appealing. I was also surprised to see that the game uses two frogs. The player controls the frog on the x axis, and the frog on the y axis is controlled by the computer.
What amazed me the most is that the computer-controlled frog is not just following a fixed route. It actually reacts to the situation in real time, which makes the gameplay more exciting and challenging. This kind of AI enemy design is a very clever idea and the coding behind it must be quite advanced. I can clearly see how much effort and thought Ben put into this project.

I love how Skyla’s work plays with the double meaning of the word “bug.” It refers to both insects and computer errors, which makes her concept very clever. Her idea of fixing the game by eating bugs was really creative. Each time the character eats a bug, the game becomes a little more functional. For example, after eating a bug, the background suddenly loads in. I think she achieved this using if statements that are triggered by the number of bugs eaten, such as if the number of bugs reaches two, then the background appears.
Instead of using a frog as the main character, she chose a venus flytrap, which fits the theme perfectly. The tongue movement was also interesting because it did not travel in a straight line. It followed a slightly curved path, which made the animation feel more natural and fun to watch. I also really enjoyed her art style. It looks like old newspaper print, giving the game a vintage and unique aesthetic.

Aliyah’s work has the best game art I have seen so far. The pixel art is super beautiful and the color combinations look very harmonious. It is also the only game that included an intro scene with a story, and the writing was funny and engaging. I really appreciated that the intro gives the player the option to skip it if they do not want to read. This shows that she thought about the player’s experience.
The gameplay itself was very creative and quite different from the sample code. The tongue feature was removed, and instead the mouse controls both the x and y positions of the character, which gives a completely new way of playing. What makes the game more challenging is the bombs that the character needs to avoid. This adds excitement and tension because players cannot just focus on catching things, they also need to move strategically to stay safe. It makes the gameplay more dynamic, fun, and unpredictable.
