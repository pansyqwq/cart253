## Description

>For the artjam project. I've created a Pansy flower, which is my english name. I've made the flower into a paintbrush to freely paint on the cnavas. 

> The experience is controlled via the mouse, dragging the mouse around the canvas will create a flower every frame. 

> The project is meant to create a self portrait for myself, I went into a more abstract direction.
