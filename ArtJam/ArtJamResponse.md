My classmate Weini Wang created a cute digital illustration of a yellow frog-like character in a simple, stylized environment. She told me it’s her spirit animal. I really love what she did with the eyes — they’re large and shiny, with sparkling white stars inside the black pupils that give the character an innocent, amazed expression. I especially like the blinking effect; it makes the eyes feel alive and expressive. She used if for the blinking effect that triggers the animation when pressed. I did not use a lot of if sentences in my work, I learned a lot from her work. I also love her snow-falling effect. For a complex shape like a snowflake, she didn’t use an image as most people would; instead, she cleverly used a snowflake emoji, which works perfectly well and fits the playful style of her artwork.

	My classmate Sean did an excellent job on this project. He mentioned that he has several years of experience with JavaScript, which explains why his work feels so complex and complete. I definitely learned a lot from studying his project. For example, he divided the canvas into many small grids, with each grid consisting of just one color, just like creating a detailed piece of pixel art. The blinking animation of the character was achieved by dynamically changing the grid colors. The work was so interactive as well. We can freely change the eyes, eyebrows, lips, skin color, and hair. He also did a great job organizing the layout of his web page; even though there are many functions, his instructions are very clear and easy to follow. Sean’s work was very eye opening to me.

Jason created a cool and vibrant piece. He used the random function to generate a continuous effect, where hundreds of dots move within a circular frame. The result looks like a glitching computer screen, creating a dynamic and mesmerizing visual. I actually helped him debug the project. Although I didn’t manage to solve the problem myself, the process taught me a lot. I realized that instead of making the dots move, his code was creating new dots every frame and assigning them to random positions. After a few rounds of console.log testing and some help from our professor, we discovered that the issue came from a misspelled function. Once we commented out the problematic line, the program ran perfectly.

It was a valuable experience,I became more comfortable using random and console.log and most importantly, I gained a new friendship through this collaboration.

​​​​​​Norah created a whimsical little cat as a representation of herself. She’s very good at using simple shapes to capture complex ideas. I love her art style—she avoided sharp shapes for the cat body. Almost all the corners are drawn with smooth curves, which is definitely more challenging to code. This design choice creates a beautiful visual contrast, the round body outstands the pointy cat ears and mouth. I also really like her idea of rotating the eyeball, it’s such a simple yet effective way to add life and motion to the character.

Ahmad did a great job on this art jam, and his work perfectly captured how sleepy he usually is. The background switches between light blue and dark blue, and the moon smoothly transitions into the sun. The movement of the hand is fun and interactive, it adds a playful touch to the piece. It must have been quite challenging to make the hand move, since he had to assign the coordinates of such a complex shape to the same x and y values and then link them to the mouse.
