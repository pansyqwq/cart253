# Mod Jam ideas

1. Frog change color when ate the fly(ex: a brighter green), change red when missed. (can I make the success of eating more obvious? can I do it by changing the color of the frog?)

2. A role reversed level, the Frog moves on its own and player controls the fly. The coordinate of the fly will be controled by the mouse.  The frog will move randomly and attack ramdonly. (Can I do a role reverse level?, make the player control the fly?)

3. In advanced level of the 2rd idea there will be multiple frogs, attacking vertically and horizontally. (Can I make the danger coming from x and y axis? The original frof is only attacking from the bottom, I'll make the level more challenging by adding more frog in more directions)

4. The frog will do n number of attacks in a level, the endscene will be triggered when the frog did n attacks. different end scenes will be revealed based on the number of eaten flies(Ex: if eaten 50% of the flies, the page says Congradulation! the frog had a large feast!) (Can I reward the player if they perform really well in the game? Or fail them if they did poorly?)

5. The fly is only moving in the same y axis, make the fly go up and down. in more advanced level, put flies in different speed or even accelerate. (Can I make the route of the fly more complicated? Can I adjust the speed of the fly?)

6. Make the froh learn a skill, to make the eating easier. Ex: skill name: big mouth. After eating 4 flies, the frog will have a large tongue for the next eating attempt, the skill will need to recharge after used. （many games have skills for the characters, Can I also do one for our frog？）

7. When you complete a level, a new character lizard will be unlocked. The lizard can have different statistics compared to frog, for example：attack faster but move slower. The player can switch characters freely between the two. （Can we adjust the abilities of the frog？ what if it's a new character？）

8. The frog will upgrade based on the total number of flies eaten in all the levels.（Ex： eaten total 30 flies, upgrade to level 2）The upgrade will increase the abilities of the frog, make it faster and bigger. (A lot of games have upgrade system, can we do the same thing for our game？)

9. The frog will be a long human arm trying to pet a cat. The fly will be a cat who runs around and doesn't want to be pet (I want to pet my cat so bad, Can I do a game about that？)

10. Continue on the 9th idea. There will be mice running around as well, we don't want to touch the mice. We need to avoid touching it. Trigger fail scene if touched the mouse. (Getting my idea from game Fruit Ninja, in that game u need to avoid cutting the bomb)
