# Mod Jam ideas

1. Frog change color when ate the fly(ex: a brighter green), change red when missed. (can I make the success of eating more obvious? can I do it by changing the color of the frog?)
2. A role reversed level, the Frog moves on its own and player controls the fly. The coordinate of the fly will be controled by the mouse.  The frog will move randomly and attack ramdonly. (Can I do a role reverse level?, make the player control the fly?)
3. In advanced level of the 2rd idea there will be multiple frogs, attacking vertically and horizontally. (Can I make the danger coming from x and y axis? The original frof is only attacking from the bottom, I'll make the level more challenging by adding more frog in more directions)
4. The frog will do n number of attacks in a level, the endscene will be triggered when the frog did n attacks. different end scenes will be revealed based on the number of eaten flies(Ex: if eaten 50% of the flies, the page says Congradulation! the frog had a large feast!) (Can I reward the player if they perform really well in the game? Or fail them if they did poorly?)
